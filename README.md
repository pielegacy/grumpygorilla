# Grumpy Gorilla
A game about a very grumpy gorilla
--------------------------

I have no idea what I'm going to do with this game as it is a stupid idea

## Requirements for compiling

- You're gonna need MonoGame
- Visual Studio is what I used but I'm sure MonoDevelop will do the job

## Notes for compilation of content

Game will royally fuck itself if you don't copy all the contents of the content folder into 
the content folder of your release or debug folder within bin 

This is just a thing with MonoGame, you can view some of my development contributions [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNcepEZ9TLOy66qFEoO7XvFgki_rmYrnq)
